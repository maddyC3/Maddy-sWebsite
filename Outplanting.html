	<center><p>After corals have grown to a significant size on their coral tree,<br> the corals are selected and moved to an "Outfield". This is where structures,<br>looking similarly like the metal frame of a box, are built and Corals are carefully ziptied down to grow into a formation. </p></center>

<p>Coral must be placed in a specific pattern around the metal structures. Make sure the Coral Polyps are touching. That is the part of coral anatomy that grows, this way the coral can grow together and eventually become one big cluster</p>
