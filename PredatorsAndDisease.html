	<h1><center>Predators and disease</center></h1>

	<center><p>In modern times, Coral is facing a variety of predators and disease that was previously quite rare. <br>Nowadays, with invasive species having been exported around the world, <br>Coral numbers and statistics are dropping quite rapidly</p></center>

			<th><p>If you look closely, these are snails. <br>A common  predator for corals. <br>Divers are trained to remove any <br>snails spotted on the corals, but sometimes <br>hermit crabs are mistaken for snails.<br> In this case, hermit crabs are harmless</p></th>

			<th><p>This is a fireworm. Another invasive predator <br>of coral. While these are also supposed to be <br>removed, be careful. These worms have <br>spines that when come in contact with bare <br>skin, can cause an intense burning <br>sensation. Hence the name</p></th></tr>
